Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in systems design and testing, and have opportunities to present your work to your team and the wider org. Each intern has a dedicated intern manager, and every project is part of the team’s roadmap and will directly help Stripe’s mission.

What you’ll do
Every internship at Stripe centers around a real, legitimate project that our customers urgently need, touching many parts of our operations and stack. We will support you in shipping it. Yes, you will actually ship it. Some recent projects include rebuilding our statistics aggregation service, building new service discovery systems, and many user facing projects like making it easy to understand error messages on Stripe Checkout. As a Stripe intern, you'll be tackling important projects to increase global commerce, while working alongside exceptional people who insist on doing their best work. You’ll learn from people with high standards who are great at inspiring others to do more and go further. We value technical and personal growth, and see our internship program as a vehicle to foster both.

Responsibilities
Write software that will be used in production, and has meaningful impact to Stripe
Give and receive technical feedback through code reviews or design discussions
Collaborate with other engineers and cross-functional stakeholders to proactively seek and incorporate feedback

Who you are
We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum requirements
A strong fundamental understanding of computer science through pursuit of a Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD degree in computer science, math, or a related discipline
Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects, including open source contributions, that demonstrate evaluating and receiving feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts
Preferred qualifications
At least 2 years of university education, or equivalent work experience
One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
Understanding and some experience writing high quality pull requests, with good test coverage, and working knowledge to complete projects with minimal defects
Familiarity with navigating and managing your work in new code bases, with multiple languages
Ability to write clearly to explain your work to stakeholders, team members, and other Stripes

Pay and benefits
The annual US base salary range for this role is $123,500 - $123,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.

The financial industry is growing at a record pace, but our data providers are still stuck in the past — with cumbersome onboarding processes, complicated APIs, slow infrastructure, and expensive licensing costs.

Databento is the next-generation market data provider — with the radical idea that you should only pay for the data that you use. We power the world's largest finance and fintech institutions and lower the barrier of entry for small startups.

Since starting in 2019, we've raised over $27.8M in funding and have over 2,000 companies signed up pre-launch. Our team consists of former data users from firms like Two Sigma, Belvedere, Pico, Bloomberg, Pinterest, and Google.

We offer health, dental, disability, and life insurance benefits, as well as 401(k) matching and visa sponsorships. We accommodate 100% remote work, with teammates living around the globe and paid in their local currency. 

Responsibilities
We have projects across the stack, from frontend UIs to backend APIs. Your projects will depend on your background and interests. 

Desired Qualifications
Experience with C++ or Python, ideally outside of the classroom (e.g. personal projects, internships, and co-ops) 
University level coursework in computer science (e.g. operating systems, computer architecture, and algorithms)
Knowledge of software design patterns and best practices
Strong written and verbal communications skills
A desire to work at a fast-growing fintech startup 
No financial experience is required. We genuinely nurture each individual to become an integral part of society, no matter where you go in the future. After the internship, you'll have the option to work part-time throughout the year until graduation. We've hired interns from as early as sophomore year, who are now a core part of our team. This internship is 100% remote and location-agnostic, so you're welcome to live where ever you want - we can pay you in your local currency, and we sponsor H1Bs and other visas. 

We accept applications on a rolling basis and are flexible on timing. Some internships last for the summer, while others last throughout the semester.
